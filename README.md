### [Crop Recommendation System](https://github.com/Premaramkarthik/crop-recommendation)

- Developed a crop recommendation system utilizing machine learning algorithms to suggest suitable crops based on environmental conditions.
- Utilized historical data containing environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, along with corresponding crop yields.
- Divided the dataset into features (environmental factors) and the target variable (crop labels).
- Trained various machine learning models including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports to assess precision, recall, and F1-score for each crop class.
- Compared the performance of different models through visualizations such as bar plots.
- Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, model development, evaluation, and visualization techniques, highlighting expertise in leveraging machine learning for practical solutions like crop recommendation.
